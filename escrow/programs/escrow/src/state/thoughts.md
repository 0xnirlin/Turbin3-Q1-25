In an escrow contract we have a maker who creates the offer, so when he creates the offer he puts some tokens in the escrow vault that escrow vault stores some state

so we want maker function and taker functions

so a maker would crete a escrow vault where he put the amount of money, the taker he put it for, the token he wants in return and how many tokens he wants

and than a taker will come in, send in the amount of money, the tokens in the vault are than send to the taker pretty much whatever the balance of that vault is

amd for each taker a new vault is created, so the seeds for the vault would be the maker, tha taker. 

Now the thing is we can give money to any taker as long as he is willinng to pay the desired tokens and desired amount for the amount of specific tokens that are inside the escrow vault

 so a vault is created using the maker seeds and the both tokens mints, this way for specific maker and specific payer of tokens the vault is created and the maker can send the tokens to the taker
